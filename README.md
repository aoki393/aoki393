## A Beginner in Video Game Development👋
在2025年，我仔细思考后决定学习电子游戏开发并希望成为一个专业的开发者，于是开始学习C#、Unity 、C++并尝试制作自己的游戏。

有灵魂的作品需要长久的投入，但我会坚持下去，因为思考、创作和设计是我生活的源动力。部分学习记录或其它相关内容我会开源到这里。

In 2025, after careful consideration, I decided to study video game development and hope to become a professional developer, so I began to learn C#, Unity and C++ and tried to make my own video game.

Works with souls need long-term investment, but I will stick to it, because thinking, creation and design are the source of my life. I will open source some study records or other related content here.
